# Image segementation of objects

We need to segment (the stained bones in the fish) the images into objects.
We will use the [Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) to do this.

To run the SAM model, we will run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
source run_segmentation.sh
```
