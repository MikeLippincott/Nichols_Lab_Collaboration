In this section, we will manually crop the images to focus on objects of interest
The crops will performed in the x, y, and z dimensions to ensure that the object of interest is the only object in the crop.
By peforming z-crops, we can ensure that the object of interest is the only object in the crop.
This is important for removing background during z-max projection.

We manually performed crops via FIJI.
