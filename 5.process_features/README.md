# Processing the feature space

We use both CytoTable and pycytominer to process the feature space.
CytoTable is used to ensure that the CellProfiler output is in the correct format for pycytominer.
Pycytominer is used to process the feature space by normalizing the data and feature selecting.

## Running the processing script
To run the processing script, execute the following command:
```
source run_feature_processing.sh
```
