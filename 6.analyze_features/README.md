# Analysis of the features
Here we analyze the features of the dataset.
We are interested in how the variance of the features is distributed.

## Running the analysis
The run analysis script uses papermill to execute the notebook.
All outputs will be saved in the notebook and any outputs that the notebook saves.

To run the analysis, execute the following command:
```
source run_analysis.sh
```
